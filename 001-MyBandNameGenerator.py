#1. I decided to call the user by it's name.
name = input('Enter your name:')   #bryan
print(f'Hi {name}! Welcome to my Band Name Generator.')
#2. Instead of the city, I decided to use user's favorite color.
color = input('Please, type your favorite color: ')
#3. Instead of using the user's pet name, I choose to use it's favorite animal.
animal = input(f'Nice {name}! Now, type your favorite animal: ')
#4. The results are pretty the same, but with nicer band names.
print(f'Wow {name}, your band name should be: {color} {animal}.')
